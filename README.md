Screenshots to describe how this simple project reduces friction with users.
I have been spending quite a bit of time lately dealing with forms (job applications mostly).  Using user events to guide form fields is a way to reduce user friction and errors.
This is a fairly simple form, from build we see this:
[![Initial Render](https://i.postimg.cc/SxsdRgfB/2021-07-12.png)](https://postimg.cc/VdxnHBTg)

But this isn't just a click and read form.  Notice how the user options change as we change our input values.
If a guest is not attending we simply aren't going to give them an option to pick a meal.  Traditionally with web forms we have used language cues to indicate if the user should fill out the form, but using the power of js we can also give the user very obvious visual cues without text.  For this form, there is instructive text but I also utilized color and visibility to lead the user.

In this particular form you can even correct the name field and have the update the form text.

As you can see this is a simple example.  Interactive forms naturally lead the users to make the right choice quickly and intuitively.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
